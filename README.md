# BafangEmulator

Emulate the Bafang controller via your serial port(s)

The inspiration behind this software was to give me a testing platform for the Bafang mid-drive e-bike configuration software. Allowing me to develop Android software to connect directly via a USB cable, and ulimately giving the end user the most cost affective solution to configuring their e-bike in the field. As currently the only available solution is to use a laptop.

This emulator can support up to 4 serial ports concurrently, and each port sharing the config file, allowing you to test each connected device is communicating correctly.

Configuration software for the Bafang mid-drive kit can be found here:

This emulator can support up to 4 serial ports, each port sharing the config file, allowing you to test each connected device is communicating correctly by comparing the results via the above configuration tool.

Documenting the code still to do, probably with doxygen.

If you find this software useful then please let me know.
